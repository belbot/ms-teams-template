# Microsoft Teams UI Template

Since we don't have something fun like Slack's message builder or Walkie for MS Teams (yet), I put together a Sketch template so you can design cards, channel messages, and 1:1 chat examples.

## Example

## More info

I don't have Segoe UI (Microsoft font) so I primarily used Lato. Message cards have images that are 16:9, so the inserts are set to 405 x 228. What else... this is my first big template, so please give your feedback and suggestions! Excited to see this grow and improve! 

## Coming soon!

- Channel tabs
- More message types

## Thanks to...
